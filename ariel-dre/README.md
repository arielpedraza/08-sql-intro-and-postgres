# Project Name

**Author**: Ariel and Dre
**Version**: 1.8.4 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application will store blog articles in a database and display them to the user with the option of filtering based on author or category. It will also allow users to create a new article in another page that will get added to the database.

## Getting Started
Starting out with NPM installed. 'npm init' in your project directory (the directory with script.js in it), 'npm install express' to install express, and add a line in your packages.js file to establish a dependency to express.js. Same steps for 'pg' package since we rely on postgreSQL now.

## Architecture
'scripts.js' - sets up initialization, middleware, and routes.
postgreSQL database - to save/retrieve article data.

## Change Log
11-02-2017 13:00 - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for database.
